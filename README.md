# purple_octopus_from_node

# The purpose of this project is to practice using node

This is a VERY basic node application that sends the purple octopus html when it receives the '/'  or '/l1' on localhost

# Not mobile friendly...yet...

I tried this on my phone today (12/14) and it looks awful and there is no control. 
I attempted to add a button for player control and it made it worse.

# Ideas????

1) Get the size of the browser window 
2) Convert the size to px (Canvas only takes px)
3) Create a base "unit" to scale all drawing objects relative to canvas window (this will be global scope)
4) Make all the draw functions take the unit to scale their primitive shapes in terms of base unit

...hopefully that will work
